										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Through the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) program, the Blended Visa Office Referred (BVOR) program, the Joint Assistance Sponsorship (JAS) program, and the Government Assisted Refugee (GAR) program, refugees who are sponsored and resettled to Canada may receive a Transportation Loan. This loan is designed to assist them in covering the expenses associated with their travel to Canada. Issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), the Transportation Loan is available through their <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/immigration-loans-program.html">Immigration Loans Program (ILP)</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have attached a file which shares details of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How is the Transportation Loan issued to the sponsored refugee?</li>
<li>What does the Transportation Loan cover?</li>
<li>Are Immigration Medical Examinations (IMEs) still covered by the Immigration Loans Program (ILP)?</li>
<li>Is interest charged on the Transportation Loan?</li>
<li>When are sponsored refugees expected to repay the Transportation Loan?</li>
<li>What is the repayment schedule for the Transportation Loan?</li>
<li>Can sponsored refugees to defer repayment of the Transportation Loan?</li>
<li>Are sponsors expected or required to assist the sponsored refugees with repaying their Transportation Loan?</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has developed a Sponsorship Cost Table to provide sponsoring groups with an estimate of the financial resources required to support a refugee family for twelve months. Recognizing varying levels of cost of living in different regions across Canada, this table serves as a financial guideline and is roughly based on the rates of social assistance.</p>
<h2>Sponsorship Cost Table</h2>
<p>The following Sponsorship Cost Tables are taken from IRCC’s Financial Guideline as provided in the Refugee Sponsorship Application Kit. The cost table was updated on <strong>May 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018</strong>.</p>
<table class="table">
<thead>
<tr>

<p>The financial resources that a refugee family brings with them to Canada can reduce the amount of financial support that a sponsoring group must provide. However, please note that a contingency plan is still needed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Preparing refugee sponsorship applicants for an interview</h2>
<p>The interview is an important part of the refugee sponsorship application process. Applicants are invited to an interview at a Visa Office abroad via email or by phone. The purpose of the interview is to establish whether the applicant is eligible and admissible for resettlement to Canada under the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program and whether resettlement to Canada is the best solution to the applicant’s situation.</p>
<p>Since the decision of the Visa Officer depends significantly on the outcome of the interview, this document will offer some recommendations on how to prepare for an interview and what to do during and after the interview.<sup>1</sup> Please note that this document does not represent legal advice; however, it may serve as a guideline to help you better prepare for your interview.</p>
<h2>Before the interview</h2>
<p>Carefully <strong>review copies of all application forms</strong> and <strong>supporting documents</strong> that were submitted to the IRCC with respect to your application. If you do not have the copies of the application package, please let your sponsors know immediately so that they may help you obtain the copies. When reviewing the application forms and supporting documents, please pay attention to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the family composition indicated in the forms still the same? If there are any changes infamily composition (e.g. marriages, newborn or adopted children, or deaths) that are notreflected in the application forms, please inform the Visa Office and your sponsors immediatelyso that the forms can be updated.</li>
<li>In the application forms <strong>ALL</strong> your family members (i.e. your spouse/common law partner, youor your spouse/common law partner&#8217;s children under the age of 22 and any children under the age of 22 of you or your spouse/common law partner&#8217;s dependent children) should be mentioned, including those who are missing, whose whereabouts are not known or who are presumed to be dead. If you notice that some of your family members (both accompanying and non-accompanying) are not included on the forms, namely on the Generic Application Form for Canada and the Sponsorship Undertaking and Settlement Plan, please inform your sponsors and the Visa Office immediately so that the forms can be updated.</li>
<li>Make sure that the contact information (phone number and email address) on the forms is <strong>correct</strong> and <strong>up-to-date</strong>, as this is the information the Visa Office will use to communicate withyou and invite you for an interview. Also ensure that other information on the forms, such as your personal history, list of addresses and refugee story, is also <strong>correct</strong> and <strong>up-to-date</strong>. If you find any mistakes in the application forms, please notify your sponsors and the Visa Office immediately so that the forms can be updated.</li>
<li>Make sure that you have provided <strong>all available</strong> supporting documents that are <strong>relevant to your case</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
<p><strong>Examples of supporting documents</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proof of your personal refugee story (e.g. news articles, letters, statements from friends and family, police reports, medical reports etc.);</li>
<li>Documents showing what happened to other people who faced a situation similar to yours (forexample, relatives who were recognized as refugees);</li>
<li>All available personal identification documents (such as a passport, ID cards, refugee documents);</li>
<li>Documents related to your marital status and the composition of your family (e.g. marriage and divorce certificates, birth or baptism certificates of your children, etc.);</li>
<li>All documents and letters issued to you by the UNHCR or the government of the country where you are currently living;</li>
<li>Documents related to your status in the country where you are currently living;</li>
<li>Documents showing your problems in the country where you are currently living; and,</li>
<li>Documents showing compelling medical and/or psychological problems (such as doctor’s reports, medical conditions, etc.)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Know your refugee story</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that one of the most common reasons for rejection is inconsistency that occurs when facts given at the interview are different from the information provided in the application forms. As a result, carefully <strong>read your personal refugee story</strong> that is on the Schedule 2: Refugees Outside Canada form that was submitted to IRCC as part of your application package. While reviewing your story, please pay attention to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that all <strong>events</strong> that happened to you (and your family) are <strong>true</strong> and <strong>accurate</strong>;</li>
<li><strong>Remember your refugee story well</strong>. We recommend <strong>you make a list of important details</strong> regarding the <strong>time, date and location</strong> of the events that happened to your <strong>family and persons or organizations</strong> associated with your situation and story, as you may forget these details during the interview.</li>
<li><strong>Practice the interview</strong> in advance with someone you trust. The person can ask you questions about your life in your home country and the reasons why you had to flee.</li>
<li><strong>If you notice mistakes</strong> in your personal refugee story or you believe that some of the relevant events, incidents or dates are missing, please inform the Visa Office and your sponsor about this <u>prior to the interview</u>;</li>
<li>If you would like to <strong>add information</strong> about some relevant events that happened to you or the members of your family, which are not already mentioned in your personal story, please inform the Visa Office and your sponsors in writing immediately.</li>
</ul>
<h2>During the interview</h2>
<p>The Visa Office will inform you of the date, time, and place of your interview. <u>Do not miss your interview date</u>.</p>
<ul>
<li>You should arrive at the specified location on the day and time given to you. You should not be late. Try to arrive prior to the interview time.</li>
<li>You will be interviewed by a Canadian Visa Officer. If you have requested an interpreter, the interpreter will also be in the room with you and the Visa Officer.</li>
<li>The Visa Officer will ask you about the <strong>nature and causes of your personal refugee story and the current situation in your home country and the country you are currently in</strong>, e.g., why you had to leave your home country, why you cannot go back and why you cannot stay where you are.</li>
<li>In addition, you may also be asked about your education, work experience, family life, French and English skills, knowledge of Canada and motivation to settle there.</li>
</ul>
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
<p><strong>What to bring to the interview</strong></p>
<p>Please bring the <strong>originals</strong> of all the documents in your possession, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification documents for you and all family members included in your application.</li>
<li>Documents that can support your refugee story and your fear of persecution at home</li>
<li>If you bring new documents to the interview, ones you could not submit to the Visa Office before, you will need to explain to the Visa Officer why you could not provide them prior to the interview.</li>
<li>If any of your documents are not in English or French, please bring a translated copy.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have any of the required documents, please be prepared to explain to the Visa Officer the reasons why you do not have them.</p>
</div>
<h3>How to conduct yourself during the interview</h3>
<ul>
<li>Do not be afraid of the Visa Officer who will conduct the interview. Ask questions at the start of the interview about the purpose of the interview, the role of the Visa Officer and the interpreter (if applicable) and the format of the interview.</li>
<li>You should <strong>trust</strong> the Visa Officer and give <strong>complete and truthful</strong> answers to their questions. Answer all questions to the best of your knowledge and ability and give answers that are clear and straight to the point.</li>
<li>If you did not understand the question, <strong>do not be shy</strong>. Ask the Visa Officer to repeat or rephrase this question for you.</li>
<li><strong>Do not exaggerate</strong> your story. You should only <strong>tell the truth</strong>, even if it sounds too simple. Remember that <strong>providing false, fabricated or embellished information may result in your application being rejected</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Do not hide</strong> information from the Visa Officer.</li>
<li>Do not assume that the Visa Officer knows something that is obvious to you; you should <strong>tell everything</strong> what you expect the Visa Officer to know. Especially when it comes to certain <strong>traditions</strong> and <strong>cultural peculiarities</strong> that are relevant to your personal refugee story. You should carefully explain everything that you want the Visa Officer to know.</li>
<li>If you have <strong>family members</strong> who are also part of the application, make sure you also talk about any risks of danger that they would face if returned to their home country. This also includes risks to your spouse/common law partner and children.</li>
<li>If you have submitted <strong>documents</strong> previously, you can remind the Visa Officer of the documents and point out how they support your story.</li>
<li>Make sure to tell the Visa Officer if there has been any <strong>changes in your family composition</strong>. If you recently got married or had a child, let the Visa Officer know. <strong>If you do not declare your new family members, they may never be allowed to join you in Canada later on</strong>.</li>
<li>If you are nervous, upset or need a break to compose yourself, do not be shy or afraid to ask the Visa Officer for a break.</li>
<li><strong>Do not leave the interview without saying everything</strong> that you wanted to tell the Visa Officer. If you do not fully state during the interview all the dangers that you faced or may face if you return home, then the Visa Officer may not consider these dangers when making the decision.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Working with an interpreter</h3>
<p>If you do not speak French or English, interpreters can assist you during the interview. <strong>If you have to use the help of an interpreter during the interview:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you <strong>understand the interpreter</strong> and the interpreter can understand you;</li>
<li>Answer all questions <strong>clearly and break each answer into short parts</strong>, so the interpreter is able to translate every word you say. <strong>Remember</strong>: interpreters are not allowed to summarize your answer or omit any parts of your answer, they must interpret your answer fully and accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Do not be afraid to speak truthfully</strong> in front of the interpreter, regardless of their religious, cultural, or ethnic background. The role of the interpreter is to help you and the Visa Officer understand each other. The interpreter cannot influence the decision of the Visa Officer.</li>
<li>If you think that the interpreter <strong>made a mistake or omitted some of the information</strong>, you should inform the Visa Officer immediately. Do not be afraid to interrupt, if you need to correct a mistake made by the interpreter.</li>
<li><strong>If the interpreter</strong> misquotes you or misunderstands what you have said to them, do not be shy or afraid to correct them.</li>
<li><strong>Do not wait until the end of the interview</strong> to tell the Visa Officer that you think the interpreter made mistakes or that they misunderstood what you said.</li>
<li>If you are convinced that the interpreter provided to you is <strong>not doing a good job</strong>, please <strong>inform the Visa Officer immediately</strong>. For example, if the interpreter does not speak exactly the same language or dialect as you, and that causes misunderstanding, you should politely inform the Visa Officer and ask for another interpreter immediately.</li>
<li>If you do not feel comfortable about sharing the details of your personal refugee story with the interpreter due to their gender, e.g. you are female and the interpreter is male (or vice-versa), you should politely inform the Visa Officer and ask for an interpreter that is the same gender as you.</li>
</ul>
<h2>After the Interview</h2>
<p>A Visa Officer may make the decision and share it with you at the end of the interview. However, in most cases, a Visa Officer may need more time to make the decision.</p>
<p>If after the interview you obtain any new documents, please immediately submit them to the Visa Office and your sponsors.</p>
<p>If you think that something went wrong during the interview, for example you forgot to mention some important facts, please inform the Visa Office and your sponsors in writing immediately. It is also recommended that right after the interview you prepare a summary of your interview starting with the point you entered the building, a list of questions that you were asked and the answers that you gave.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Refusal letters</h2>
<p>If a privately sponsored refugee has been refused and you want to better understand the reasons for refusal, the first step is to review the refusal letter. Copies of the refusal letter are often sent to both the sponsor and the applicant. The letter explains why the Visa Officer was not satisfied that the applicant met the requirements for resettlement to Canada. You may wish to ask the applicant to describe any concerns the Officer expressed at the interview. Familiarizing yourself with the eligibility and admissibility guidelines may help you understand how the Officer came to their decision.</p>
<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert"><strong>CAIPS</strong> – Computer Assisted Immigration Processing System – is IRCC’s tracking system for cases processed overseas.</div>
<h2>Requesting More Information</h2>
<p>If, after reviewing the information available, you require more information about the decision-making process or about the decision itself, you can send an enquiry by e-mail to the Visa Office where the decision was made. Visa Office e-mail addresses are available at: <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/offices/missions.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.cic.gc.ca/english/information/offices/missions.asp</a>. Inquiries should be sent only if the information is not available in the refusal letter, on the website, or in the manual.</p>
<p><i>Please note that in order to release any personal information from the applicant’s file to you, the Visa Office needs to receive the applicant’s signed consent in writing (see Getting Permission). This may already be on file, or may be scanned and attached to your e-mail inquiry.</i></p>
<h2>Getting Permission</h2>
<p>Please note that in order to release any personal information from the applicant’s file to the sponsor the Visa Office needs to receive the applicant’s signed consent in writing. The refugee and all family members over 18 must have signed the <i>IMM5476 Use of Representative form</i> available at: <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/IMM5476E.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/IMM5476E.PDF</a> and the <i>IMM5475 Authority to Release Personal Information to a Designated Individual form</i> available at: <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/IMM5475E.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.cic.gc.ca/english/pdf/kits/forms/IMM5475E.pdf</a>. The Privacy Act requires that the applicant provide consent for the release of case specific information. This is also true if you wish to make request for the CAIPS notes under the <i>Access to Information Act</i>. Answers to frequently asked questions about making requests under these acts are available on the IRCC website: <a href="http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/atip/faq.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.cic.gc.ca/english/department/atip/faq.asp</a></p>
<h2>Requesting CAIPS</h2>
<p>Under the Access to Information Act, a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or a person inside Canada can request a complete copy of the complete IRCC file relating to the person’s resettlement application. The sponsor can submit a request on behalf of the refugee so long as the appropriate forms have been completed<i>.</i> An<i> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/transparency/access-information-privacy/forms/request-5563.html">Access to Information and Personal Information Request</a> (IMM5563)</i> needs to be completed.  <i>Note: You don’t need to fill in the Requester’s reference no. or ATIP file no. boxes – those areas do not apply in this case.</i></p>
<p>Send the forms and an administrative fee payable to the Receiver General of Canada to:</p>
<p>Access to Information and Privacy Division<br />
Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada<br />
Ottawa, ON K1A 1L1</p>
<h2>What to look for in a case</h2>
<p>Although it is possible to apply for judicial review in all rejected cases, this is a costly process and best used in certain cases. When deciding whether to proceed with a negative decision you should look for:</p>
<ul>
<li>A well-documented case: good narrative provided to the Visa Officer, supporting documents, etc.</li>
<li>If credibility is stated as part of the Visa Officer’s decision, this will be harder to review because you will only have a paper document when proving your case</li>
<li>Relevant factual evidence that is ignored or not believed is a good example of a case to go forward with; so are comments that disclose a clear bias or CAIPS notes that show the Officer was not aware of a basic element of the case.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Judicial Review</h2>
<p>There is no appeal mechanism in Canadian Refugee Resettlement law; instead there is the possibility of a judicial review.</p>
<p>While an appeal can be done based on the merits of the case, in the case of a judicial review, the Court cannot substitute its decision for that of the decision maker. Rather, the Court examines the process that led to the decision and determines if this process was fair and the decision was reasonable. If the Court determines that it was not, the Court will only quash the decision in question and order a redetermination. A lawyer must apply for judicial review on behalf of the refugee.</p>
<p>Review by the Federal Court is a two-stage process. In the first stage, which is known as the “application for leave” stage, the Court reviews the documents and legal arguments related to your case. You must show the Court that an error was made in the decision or that the decision was not fair or reasonable. If leave is given, this means the Court has agreed to examine the decision in greater depth. At this second stage, called “judicial review,” an oral hearing is held before the Court in order to explain why the original decision was wrong.</p>
<h2>Tips to Avoid Negative Decisions</h2>
<p>Although applying for judicial review is possible, sponsors must focus on proactive work, such as thorough case assessments, in order to avoid negative decisions.</p>
<p>It is important that sponsors <strong>ensure that a case is well-documented when it is submitted</strong>. That includes identity and corroborating documents such as police or medical reports, employment letters, etc, as well as objective reports on country conditions from organizations such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the US Department of State, the UNHCR, and major media outlets. Remember: documents can be filed up until the point a decision is made. Even after the interview if a sponsor learns that issues came up during the interview that lead them to believe that there needs to be clarification, supporting documents can still be submitted to the Visa Office, so long as a final decision has not yet been made. Any information received up until that point should be taken into consideration. This is part of procedural law that allows people to submit the best case possible. If this type of situation arises, it is important to notify the Visa post immediately in writing that you will be sending further evidence and request that no decision be rendered until that new evidence has been received.</p>
<p><strong>Interview preparation</strong> is very important when possible. Talk to the refugee before they go into the interview. It is important for the refugee to understand what is going to happen and the purpose of the interview. Review the key facts the refugee needs to convey to the Visa Officer. Emphasize the importance of focusing on what they know and admitting what they do not know. Also emphasize that if they have ANY concerns about the interpreter or the quality of the interpretation they should raise it with the Officer immediately during the interview.</p>
<p><strong>Post-interview debriefing</strong> is very useful should the case be refused and subsequently taken to Court. Having the refugee(s) recount what happened at the interview, what was asked, what they answered, whether there were problems with the interpreter, whether the Officer appeared to be listening or distracted, etc., provides a record that can be used to rebut any differing report of the interview.</p>
