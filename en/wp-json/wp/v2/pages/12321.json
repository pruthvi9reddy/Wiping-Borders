It also helps sponsors: they can support each other while preparing for sponsorship, welcoming newcomers and helping them settle.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Form a group<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There are many ways to find members for a Group of Five. Here\u2019s a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use social media to invite friends, acquaintances or neighbours to join.<\/li>\n<li>Host a casual information session at your home or workplace for friends, family, coworkers or neighbours. During the Syrian refugee crisis, many successful sponsorship groups were formed by neighbours who did not yet know each other well.<\/li>\n<li>Invite club, union, community organization or church members to join you.<\/li>\n<li>Invite people attending a milestone celebration to help you sponsor a refugee(s), instead of giving a gift. One couple did this at their wedding. This could be done at a retirement party, a birthday party or any other special event.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You might consider hosting a Facebook watch party featuring some of the many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/bvor\/bvor-sponsor-videos\/\">BVOR Sponsor Videos<\/a> on the RSTP website.
