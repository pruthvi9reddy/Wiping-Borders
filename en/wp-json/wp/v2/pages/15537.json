We match refugees sponsored by all types of sponsoring groups with settlement workers that we have trained to understand the dynamics of refugee sponsorship and to complement the settlement support offered by sponsors.<\/p>\n<p>The project has two main goals:<\/p>\n<p>1. To improve sponsored refugees\u2019 access to settlement services.<\/p>\n<p>2. To support sponsoring groups in providing settlement support.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"#sponsors\">Support for sponsors<\/a> | <a href=\"#refugees\">Support for sponsored refugees<\/a> | <a href=\"#settlementworkers\">Training for settlement workers<\/a> | <a href=\"#contactinfo\">Got questions?<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2><strong>What services do settlement workers provide?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Settlement workers complement and enhance the settlement support given by private sponsoring groups.
