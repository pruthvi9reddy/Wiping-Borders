Their activities may include conducting investigations, gathering information and reporting on violations to bring them to the attention of the public and governments, supporting victims, advocating for policies and education and outreach.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Human rights defenders may be targeted, harassed, and persecuted by the authorities and non-state actors as a means of dissuading them from their work. Human rights defenders, including their families, have suffered reprisals and have been arbitrarily arrested and detained, tortured, summarily executed, victims of false accusations and unfair trials and convictions. Because of this, human rights defenders may be forced to leave their home country and it may be unsafe for them to return.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>DOWNLOAD THE PDF VERSION OF THIS DOCUMENT &nbsp; Women-at-Risk Women and girls face unique or gender-related forms of persecution, including sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV), which may force them to [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":0,"parent":10009,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_relevanssi_hide_post":"","_relevanssi_hide_content":"","_relevanssi_pin_for_all":"","_relevanssi_pin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_unpin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_include_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_exclude_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_no_append":"","_relevanssi_related_not_related":"","_relevanssi_related_posts":"","_relevanssi_noindex_reason":"","passster_activate_protection":false,"passster_protect_child_pages":"","passster_protection_type":"password","passster_password":"","passster_activate_overwrite_defaults":"","passster_headline":"","passster_instruction":"","passster_placeholder":"","passster_button":"","passster_id":"","passster_activate_misc_settings":"","passster_redirect_url":"","passster_hide":"no","passster_area_shortcode":"","_price":"","_stock":"","_tribe_ticket_header":"","_tribe_default_ticket_provider":"","_tribe_ticket_capacity":"0","_ticket_start_date":"","_ticket_end_date":"","_tribe_ticket_show_description":"","_tribe_ticket_show_not_going":false,"_tribe_ticket_use_global_stock":"","_tribe_ticket_global_stock_level":"","_global_stock_mode":"","_global_stock_cap":"","_tribe_rsvp_for_event":"","_tribe_ticket_going_count":"","_tribe_ticket_not_going_count":"","_tribe_tickets_list":[],"_tribe_ticket_has_attendee_info_fields":false},"meta_box":{"front_blocks":[]},"ticketed":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/15240"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/11"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=15240"}],"version-history":[{"count":45,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/15240\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":15304,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/15240\/revisions\/15304"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/10009"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=15240"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
