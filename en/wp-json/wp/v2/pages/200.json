Who signs the Undertaking and Financial Assessment forms on behalf of the Community Sponsor?<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"s5\">The Executive Director, President or CEO of the Community Sponsor (depending on the organization\u2019s structure) must provide written authorization on letterhead designating the Community Sponsor representative to sign the Undertaking on behalf of the Community Sponsor. This CS Representative would then sign the Sponsorship Undertaking form; however, the Executive Director, President or CEO <\/span><span class=\"s6\">must<\/span><span class=\"s5\"> be the one to sign for the Community Sponsor on the Financial Assessment form. <\/span><span class=\"s5\">Should no Representative be designated<\/span><span class=\"s5\">, the Executive Director, President or CEO must sign <\/span><span class=\"s6\">both<\/span><span class=\"s5\"> the Undertaking and Financial Assessment.

If a co-sponsor of a Community Sponsor organization is a individual representing a larger sponsoring group who are not an organization, would it be sufficient for the Group Representative to sign the Sponsor Assessment and include documentation noting the wider group members to show the depth of settlement support for the sponsorship?<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p class=\"s15\"><span class=\"s5\">The co-sponsor in a CS signs the Sponsorship Undertaking and submits a signed and completed Sponsor Assessment Form.
