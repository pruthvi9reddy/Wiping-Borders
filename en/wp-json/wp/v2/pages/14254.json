Appendix A of the Sponsorship Application Guide for SAHs indicates<\/em><br \/>\n<em>that 70% of the RAP entitlement can be deducted for donated furniture items, which would result<\/em><br \/>\n<em>in a maximum deduction of $2,229.507 <span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">(7)<\/span><\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>Because the estimated value of the donated items is lower than the maximum in-kind deduction<\/em><br \/>\n<em>amount, you can deduct the full $500 value for the donated furniture, reducing the furniture<\/em><br \/>\n<em>allowance cost to $2,685.

What is the required level of financial support for cases that were submitted<br \/>\nbefore the current Sponsorship Agreement came into effect on January 1, 2018?<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p>One of the changes between the 2011 and 2019 Sponsorship Agreement was a shift from local social assistance rates to RAP rates as the baseline for financial support requirements.<\/p>\n<p>However, both the current and previous versions of the Sponsorship Agreement include the requirement for sponsors to provide support at the <strong>prevailing rates in place at the time of the\u00a0<\/strong><strong>refugee\u2019s arrival in Canada, and not at the time that the application is submitted.<\/strong> Both social assistance and RAP rates change over time, and sponsoring groups have always been expected to provide support at the rates in place at the time of the refugee\u2019s arrival and over the course of their sponsorship period.<\/p>\n<p>All cases submitted after January 1, 2018 are to be provided with the minimum baseline of required financial support as per the prevailing RAP rates and associated policies<strong> at the time of arrival and over the course of the sponsorship period<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<p>For cases submitted <strong>before<\/strong> January 1, 2018 where the sponsor is able to demonstrate that they planned to provide support at the time of arrival based on the provincial social assistance rates and associated policies, IRCC will take into consideration support provided based on social assistance and will not require RAP to be retroactively applied. IRCC may request documentation showing support given as well as the relevant social assistance rates\/policies in place at the time of arrival and over the course of the sponsorship period.<\/p>\n<p>For all cases, the sponsor is expected to create a financial budget plan based on the financial policies (whether RAP or social assistance) at the time of the Sponsorship Application submission, but actual financial support (start-up and monthly) is to be provided at the\u00a0<strong>prevailing rates<\/strong> (whether RAP or social assistance) <strong>at the time of arrival and over the course\u00a0<\/strong><strong>of the sponsorship period<\/strong>, which means that the budget\/plan will likely change from submission to arrival and contingencies should be accounted for accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>  <\/div><!-- end div.wp-spoiler -->\n<div id=\"wp-spoiler-4\" class=\"accordion-box\" data-style=\"first\">  <p class=\"accordion-title\">Q4. How does the sponsorship cost table in Appendix A of the Application Guide<br \/>\nrelate to the level of financial support to be provided?<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p>The sponsorship cost table is primarily used to provide Groups of Five\/Community Sponsors with the information needed to demonstrate that they have the financial capacity to sponsor a case at the time they are applying to sponsor. IRCC uses this information as part of its assessment for a Group of Five\/Community Sponsor application.<\/p>\n<p>The Sponsorship Cost Table is not intended for use by SAHs, because they are not subject to upfront financial capacity assessments with each sponsorship application.<\/p>\n<p>Post-arrival, all sponsoring groups (SAHs, Groups of Five, and Community Sponsors) are required to provide financial support that aligns with the RAP rates in the community where the refugee will live.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>  <\/div><!-- end div.wp-spoiler -->\n<div id=\"wp-spoiler-5\" class=\"accordion-box\" data-style=\"first\">  <p class=\"accordion-title\">Q5. What is the difference between support provided by a party to the sponsorship<br \/>\nand someone who is not?<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p>Parties to the sponsorship sign the Sponsorship Undertaking either as a Signing Authority for a larger group, such as a Constituent Group, Sponsorship Agreement Holder, or Community Sponsor or as individuals, e.g. co-sponsors. By signing the Undertaking they are committing to, and become liable for, providing financial and settlement support for the refugees listed. There can be other people who help to provide these supports during the sponsorship but only those who have signed the Sponsorship Undertaking will be held responsible if supports are not provided.<\/p>\n<p>When a case is being reviewed by IRCC post-arrival, if financial or non-financial support was provided by someone who is not party to the sponsorship <span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">(8)<\/span>, the sponsors should be able to show that this support was planned when the case was originally submitted or immediately upon arrival. There should be an established pattern of this support being provided. Such support will not be counted if it is in the form of ad hoc gifts or was initiated as a result of lack of sponsor support.<\/p>\n<p>Examples of documentation demonstrating this planned support from someone not party to the sponsorship could be the Settlement Plan on file, or emails or texts showing that there was an agreement between parties to the sponsorship and non-parties for the monthly support to be provided by someone who didn\u2019t sign the Undertaking.<\/p>\n<p>Sponsors always have the option of adding the non-party to the Undertaking to have the support be officially recognized and that person become officially liable. Adding a party to the sponsorship allows for support provided going forward to be officially recognized; it does not automatically recognize previous support given. Volunteers providing non-financial support do not need to be individually listed on the Sponsorship Undertaking or Settlement Plan if they are part of an organization that is already listed as a party to the sponsorship.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff6600;\">8<\/span> The only exception to this rule is in-kind shelter, which does not have to be provided by a party to the sponsorship; in-kind shelter, unlike other supports, may be provided by anyone other than a refugee who is within their sponsorship period. See the monthly costs section in Question 2 for additional information.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>  <\/div><!-- end div.wp-spoiler -->\n<div id=\"wp-spoiler-6\" class=\"accordion-box\" data-style=\"first\">  <p class=\"accordion-title\">Q6. How long is the sponsoring group expected to provide support? Is it possible<br \/>\nto extend the sponsorship?<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p>Sponsoring groups are responsible for giving refugees the financial and non-financial support they need when they arrive in Canada. Sponsoring groups must provide support to the refugee(s) for 12 months or until the refugee(s) becomes self-sufficient (please see Question 24 for an explanation of what is considered &#8220;self-sufficient&#8221;), whichever comes first. In exceptional cases where the migration office determines that the refugee(s) require additional time to become self-sufficient, they may request that a sponsorship be extended for to up to 36 months. The sponsoring group needs to agree to the extension period before the refugee travels to Canada.<\/p>\n<p>Before deeming the refugee to be financially self-sufficient, the sponsoring group should be making a calculation based on the earning exemptions rules outlined in Q 23. Even if the refugee is deemed to be financially self-sufficient, they may still be in need of settlement supports and assistance, which should continue to be provided as required over the duration of the sponsorship period.<\/p>\n<p>Additionally, sponsors should keep in mind that the financial situation of the family may change during the sponsorship period, and so financial support may need to be re-instated. Sponsors should remember that they may need to demonstrate that they provided the necessary financial supports at all points of the sponsorship period.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>  <\/div><!-- end div.wp-spoiler -->\n<div id=\"wp-spoiler-7\" class=\"accordion-box\" data-style=\"first\">  <p class=\"accordion-title\">Q7.

In the event of a marital breakdown, am I expected to sponsor two separate households?<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p>In situations where the family undergoes marital or household separation, the sponsoring group is not responsible for supporting 2 separate households, though they may choose to support both households if they have capacity to do so.<\/p>\n<p>If they choose to only support 1 household, the sponsor is expected to continue to support the household with the higher number of people. If both households are of equal size, it is up to the sponsoring group to decide which household they will continue to support.<\/p>\n<p>The other household is to be processed for breakdown and referred to a new sponsoring group, provincial social assistance, or the RAP (typically for BVOR cases only )<span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">(13)<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p>Sponsoring groups must contact IRCC for assistance in these situations in order for IRCC to process the partial breakdown.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><span style=\"color: #ff9900;\">13<\/span> In highly exceptional cases, SAH-sponsored PSR cases may also be referred to RAP in the event of sponsorship breakdown.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>  <\/div><!-- end div.wp-spoiler -->\n<div id=\"wp-spoiler-28\" class=\"accordion-box\" data-style=\"first\">  <p class=\"accordion-title\">Q28. Do I need to provide support if the refugee temporarily leaves the community<br \/>\nof settlement, either to other parts of Canada or overseas?<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p>If refugees leave the country for an extended period, sponsors are not expected to provide financial or non-financial support while they are absent. It is in the sponsor\u2019s best interests to report these situations and to provide proof, if available, in order to record this change with<br \/>\nIRCC.<\/p>\n<p>If a refugee leaves the community of settlement or Canada temporarily, the length of the anticipated absence and the number of members in the household that will be both travelling and remaining are considered when determining whether or not the rate of financial assistance should be affected.<\/p>\n<p>Sponsoring groups are encouraged to contact IRCC if they have any questions related to these situations.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>  <\/div><!-- end div.wp-spoiler -->\n<div id=\"wp-spoiler-29\" class=\"accordion-box\" data-style=\"first\">  <p class=\"accordion-title\">Q29. Do I need to provide support if the refugee is temporarily hospitalized or incarcerated? <\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p>Refugees entering a hospital or correctional centre do not automatically become ineligible for financial support.<\/p>\n<p>Certain factors, such as the length of the anticipated hospital or correctional centre stay and the number of members in the household, must be considered when determining whether or not the rate of financial assistance should be affected.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if the refugee is temporarily hospitalized or incarcerated, they will likely still have rental or lease obligations. They should not lose their dwelling because of these situations. There may be other expenses or factors to consider if sponsored refugees are hospitalized or<br \/>\nincarcerated.<\/p>\n<p>Sponsoring groups are encouraged to contact IRCC if they have questions related to such a situation.<\/p>\n<p><\/div>  <\/div><!-- end div.wp-spoiler -->\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>(Click here to jump to the FAQ section now) Download the .PDF Version\u00a0 These Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) apply to refugees sponsored by: Sponsorship Agreement Holders (SAHs) \u00a0Groups of Five; [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":11,"featured_media":0,"parent":11,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"top-level-temp.php","meta":{"_relevanssi_hide_post":"","_relevanssi_hide_content":"","_relevanssi_pin_for_all":"","_relevanssi_pin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_unpin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_include_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_exclude_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_no_append":"","_relevanssi_related_not_related":"","_relevanssi_related_posts":"","_relevanssi_noindex_reason":"","passster_activate_protection":false,"passster_protect_child_pages":"","passster_protection_type":"password","passster_password":"","passster_activate_overwrite_defaults":"","passster_headline":"","passster_instruction":"","passster_placeholder":"","passster_button":"","passster_id":"","passster_activate_misc_settings":"","passster_redirect_url":"","passster_hide":"no","passster_area_shortcode":"","_price":"","_stock":"","_tribe_ticket_header":"","_tribe_default_ticket_provider":"","_tribe_ticket_capacity":"0","_ticket_start_date":"","_ticket_end_date":"","_tribe_ticket_show_description":"","_tribe_ticket_show_not_going":false,"_tribe_ticket_use_global_stock":"","_tribe_ticket_global_stock_level":"","_global_stock_mode":"","_global_stock_cap":"","_tribe_rsvp_for_event":"","_tribe_ticket_going_count":"","_tribe_ticket_not_going_count":"","_tribe_tickets_list":[],"_tribe_ticket_has_attendee_info_fields":false},"meta_box":{"front_blocks":[]},"ticketed":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/14254"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/11"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=14254"}],"version-history":[{"count":47,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/14254\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":14408,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/14254\/revisions\/14408"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/11"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=14254"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
