Forming a Group<\/p><div class=\"accordion-body\"><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s5\">There is no prescribed method for forming a Group of Five.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s5\">Most of the time, Groups of Five consist of individuals who are friends, family members and\/or individuals with a common interest. They come together on a one-time basis to sponsor a refugee or refugee family.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s5\">It is up to you to find individuals within your community, family, friends and colleagues that would be willing to assist you and the refugee applicant throughout the sponsorship. IRCC and the RSTP do not assist in this process.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s5\">If you cannot find the necessary number of people who are willing to commit time, energy and financial resources, you may need to consider other ways of sponsoring the refugee (e.g. Community Sponsor or Sponsorship Agreement Holder) or assisting the refugee abroad.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s8\">What if I can only find three other people?<\/span><span class=\"s8\"> Is it possible to submit a sponsorship with fewer than five people? <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s5\">A Group of Five sponsorship must include <\/span><span class=\"s8\">at least five<\/span><span class=\"s5\"> individuals. That means that you can include more members in your group if possible, however, five must sign the application forms including the Undertaking. A\u00a0<\/span><span class=\"s5\">Group of Five sponsorship applications with fewer sponsors than five individuals <\/span><span class=\"s5\">will be rejected<\/span><span class=\"s5\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s16\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"s5\">Remember that it is only necessary for three people (out of the five) to contribute financial resources as income support during the sponsorship.

When calculating the overall budget, the Group of Five can deduct the value of any in-kind donations they receive, such as furniture or housing. Please see the in-kind deductions table in\u00a0<strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/application\/application-forms-guides\/guide-sponsor-refugee-groups-five.html#appendixA\">Appendix A of the Instructions Guide<\/a><\/strong>\u00a0for the dollar amounts that can be deducted.<\/p>\n<p class=\"s16\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">During the sponsorship period, the group is responsible for the basic needs of the sponsored refugee(s), including monthly income support.

If so, you can enter the names of other Principal Applicants in Section C.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you are completing two separate Undertaking and Settlement Plans. One is for Principal Applicant Aylin and the other for Principal Applicant Berhane. If you would like IRCC to consider Aylin\u2019s and Berhane\u2019s plans at the same time, you would put Aylin\u2019s name in Section C of Berhane\u2019s Settlement Plan. Then you would also put Berhane\u2019s name in Section C of Aylin\u2019s Settlement Plan.<\/p>\n<h2>Section D \u2013 Settlement Plan details<\/h2>\n<p>This section of the form is where you enter all the information related to your Settlement Plan.<\/p>\n<p>There are very specific instructions for this section in the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/application\/application-forms-guides\/guide-sponsor-refugee-groups-five.html\">Guide<\/a>. You must read these instructions carefully. Make sure to answer the questions in a precise way. Include all the details that IRCC asks for in the Guide.<\/p>\n<p>Each Settlement Plan must be UNIQUE. It must address the needs of the specific Principal Applicant and the dependants they have listed.<\/p>\n<p><strong>If you use the same wording from another Settlement Plan, IRCC may refuse your application.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You should include details such as who (name group member) will provide what type of support and when (state availability of person).<\/p>\n<h2>Section E \u2013 Settlement Checklist<\/h2>\n<p>Your group will use the Settlement Checklist to assign specific tasks to specific group members.<\/p>\n<p>Each task must be assigned to at least one sponsor. You must offer this support as long as it is needed by the refugee you sponsor.<\/p>\n<p>Try to have more than one sponsor assigned to each task. This will ensure the task is completed even if your group runs into difficulties.<\/p>\n<h2>Section F \u2013 Financial Assessment<\/h2>\n<p>The Financial Assessment section has six subsections. The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/en\/immigration-refugees-citizenship\/services\/application\/application-forms-guides\/guide-sponsor-refugee-groups-five.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Guide<\/a>\u00a0has precise instructions on how to complete this section. It also explains which supporting documents you need to submit. These will depend on your group\u2019s financial plan.<\/p>\n<p>For quick reference, look at the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/infosheet\/sponsorship-cost-table-2\/?format=HTML\">Sponsorship Cost Table and In-kind Deduction Table<\/a>. The In-kind Deduction Table will help you fill in the maximum possible amounts for the Donations section of the Financial Assessment.<\/p>\n<p>When filling in the One-time Start-up Costs section, please consult the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Start-up.pdf\">Start-up Costs Table<\/a>\u00a0for amounts to use.<\/p>\n<h2>Section G \u2013 Obligations, consents and declarations<\/h2>\n<p>Each signing sponsor must read this section carefully and thoroughly. It helps each sponsor understand what their legal obligations will be when they sign the form.<\/p>\n<h2>Section H \u2013 Signatures<\/h2>\n<p>The form needs to be signed by all the sponsors included in Section A.<\/p>\n<p>Please note: the form has a \u2018stale date\u2019 of 90 days. This means that IRCC must receive the application package including the Undertaking and Settlement Plan form BEFORE the signatures are 90 days old.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tip:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>As a group discuss the settlement tasks that you are responsible for. Consider each member\u2019s strengths.

This is an email and does not require any action on your part. You will require the G number to check on the status of the application and to communicate with IRCC regarding this case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\"><span class=\"s5\">If your application requires more information or correction, you will receive a letter from the ROC-O advising you of the action required and a <\/span><span class=\"s5\">time frame<\/span> <span class=\"s5\">within which you must provide the required information and\/or make the corrections and return the application to the ROC-O. If major documents are missing, ROC-O may return the entire application to the sponsoring group, without <\/span><span class=\"s5\">issuing a G number. Any corrected versions of the file will have to be mailed back and will be treated as a new application (receive a new date stamp).<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\"><span class=\"s5\">Once <\/span><span class=\"s5\">the sponsorship application has been approved by an Officer at the ROC-O<\/span><span class=\"s5\">, you will receive an approval letter from the ROC-O. <\/span><span class=\"s5\">After the sponsorship application <\/span><span class=\"s5\">has been assessed and approved at the ROC-O,<\/span><span class=\"s5\"> the file will be transferred to the visa office overseas for further processing.

The refugee applicant(s) will be invited for an eligibility interview and, if everything goes well, be provided with information about completing medical exams and other travel arrangements, including travel loans, exit visas and other preparations as needed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"s6\"><span class=\"s5\">In the meantime, you<\/span><span class=\"s5\">will receive a letter and\/or email notification that the principal refugee applicant<\/span><span class=\"s5\">\u2019<\/span><span class=\"s5\">s application <\/span><span class=\"s5\">has either been approved or refused by the visa office<\/span><span class=\"s5\">.
