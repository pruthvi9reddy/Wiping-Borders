The monthly income support for the remaining nine months of the sponsorship is provided by the sponsoring group. Rainbow Refugee Society, in collaboration with Sponsorship Agreement Holders (SAH), is responsible for submitting all applications under this partnership. LGBTQ2 refugees sponsored through this partnership will remain outside of the SAH caps.<\/p>\n<p>Through the establishment of a five year partnership, sponsors will be able to further develop their resettlement capacity while at the same time enhancing the partnerships that have developed between LGBTQ2 organizations and the larger Canadian sponsorship and settlement community.<\/p>\n<p>The application forms for this refugee sponsorship initiative are the same as a regular private refugee sponsorship case.
