Sponsorship Agreement Holders (SAHs), along with their Constituent Groups (CGs) and co-sponsors, Groups of Five and Community Sponsors are all accountable to Immigration Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) for the delivery and quality of the settlement and financial support they provide to the sponsored refugees, as outlined in their respective settlement plans.<\/p>\n<h4>Financial Responsibilities<\/h4>\n<p>Sponsorship groups must provide financial support <strong>at least<\/strong> equal to the current Resettlement Assistance Program (RAP) rates in the community where the refugee will settle. Sponsors should always refer to the most recent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/bvor\/rap-resettlement-assistance-program-rates\/\">RAP rates<\/a> and the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/sponsorship-responsibilities\/financial-faq-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">FAQs on Post-Arrival Financial Support<\/a> for the current financial standards.<\/p>\n<h4>Post-Arrival Assurance Activities and Documentation<\/h4>\n<p>All sponsors should keep evidence of financial and settlement support provided to the sponsored refugees, including documentation such as receipts for transportation, rent, food, start-up or other costs. Such documentation may be requested by IRCC as part of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/PSR-Post-Arrival-Assurance-Activities-March-2021.pdf\">post-arrival assurance activities<\/a>. For examples of documents that sponsors can submit to demonstrate support, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Case-Review-Examples-of-Documents-FINAL_July-2019.pdf\">click here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>The Obligations of SAHs<\/h4>\n<p>As noted in the Sponsorship Agreement, a SAH should monitor the activities of its CGs and co-sponsors to ensure that they fulfill their sponsorship responsibilities. The Sponsorship Agreement also notes that IRCC is responsible for monitoring the SAH, its CGs and co-sponsors. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/responsibilities\/best-practices-for-monitoring-for-sahs\/\">Best Practices for Monitoring Resource Kit<\/a> can help SAHs with monitoring their CGs and co-sponsors.<\/p>\n<h4>Two Areas of Responsibility<\/h4>\n<p>Broadly speaking, the financial and settlement responsibilities of a sponsoring group can be categorized into two areas: responsibilities that should be carried our before the arrival of refugees and responsibilities that should be implemented after the arrival of refugees.<\/p>\n<p>Each of these areas requires the sponsoring group to carry out a set of actions or activities that result in positive sponsorship outcomes and experiences. Below are the main duties under these broad categories.<\/p>\n<div class='content-column one_half'><div style=\"padding-right:20px;\"><h4>Pre-arrival Duties<\/h4>\n<p><a class=\"button style1\" style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/sponsorship-responsibilities\/responsibilities\/pre-arrival-duties\/\">Click here to read more<\/a><\/p><\/div><\/div><div class='content-column one_half last_column'><h4>Post-arrival Duties<\/h4>\n<p><a class=\"button style1\" style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/sponsorship-responsibilities\/responsibilities\/post-arrival-duties\/\">Click here to read more<\/a><\/p><\/div><div class='clear_column'><\/div><\/p>\n<p>All sponsors should partner with an IRCC-funded <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/responsibilities\/settlement-services\/find-a-settlement-service\/\">settlement agency<\/a> for support in carrying out responsibilities.
