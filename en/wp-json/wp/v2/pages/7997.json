Privacy and the Internet<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>RSTP also collects information that, alone, cannot be used to identify users (referred to as \u201cnon-personal information\u201d) through this web site. Examples of types of non-personal information that may be collected include anonymous survey responses, as well as IP addresses, cookies, Internet tags and navigational data (described in more detail below)<\/p>\n<p>An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number automatically assigned to users\u2019 computers when they access the Internet. This number does not identify the user\u2019s name, e-mail address or other personal information. This information may be used to measure site traffic, to help to understand how people are using this web site and to improve the site and services provided.<br \/>\n\u201cCookies\u201d are small text files that recognize repeat visitors, facilitate ongoing access to some sites, and allow sites to understand how and when pages are visited and by how many people. Users who are concerned about the use of cookie technology may opt to enable a feature in their browser software that will erase cookies, block all cookies, or warn the user before cookies are stored or exchanged. However, some parts of this web site may no longer function properly if cookies are disabled.<\/p>\n<p>Internet tags (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the web site server information such as the IP address and browser type related to a user\u2019s computer. Tags may indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.<\/p>\n<p>Navigational data (including log files, server logs and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, for market research purposes and to communicate information to visitors. This may include the web site you came from, your browser type, domain name and time and date of access.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. Links to Other Sites<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This web site may contain links to other sites. The provision of these links is for your convenience only, and does not constitute an endorsement, recommendation or approval of such other sites. This privacy policy is no longer applicable when you leave this site by way of link or otherwise. Linked sites may or may not maintain their own independent privacy policies and procedures. Users should consult these policies and procedures before providing any personal information.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9.
