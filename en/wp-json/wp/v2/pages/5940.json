If you are living in Quebec, please contact Immigration, Diversit\u00e9 et Inclusion for information.<\/p>\n<p>Private sponsorship means that a group of people in Canada submitted an application to bring you here, and committed to providing you with support as well as money to cover your basic expenses for the duration of your sponsorship period.<\/p>\n<p>This resource explains your\u00a0<strong>rights<\/strong>, and\u00a0<strong>what you should expect from your sponsors<\/strong>. It also explains what to do if you have concerns about the sponsorship, or believe that you are not receiving the support that you are entitled to.<\/p>\n<h3>Who are Private Sponsors?<\/h3>\n<p>Private sponsors are volunteers who have come together to sponsor you to come to Canada. They have committed to providing you with financial and settlement support. You may know your sponsors, as they could be your family members or friends, or your sponsors could be strangers that want to help you and that you are going to get to know in the coming months.<\/p>\n<h3>How Long is Your Sponsorship Period?<\/h3>\n<p>In most cases, the sponsorship period is one year. In very rare cases, the sponsorship period can be longer than one year if the Canadian government department Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) requested that sponsors provide more than one year of support before you arrived in Canada. If your sponsorship period is more than one year, you would have already been informed of this by IRCC.<\/p><\/div><\/div>\n<div class='content-column one_fourth last_column'><strong>Download the PDF versions in:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(<a href=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Rights-of-PSR-Oct.-2019-FINAL-with-logos.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">English<\/a>)<br \/>\n(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/Rights-of-PSRs-FRENCH.-Oct-2019.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">French<\/a>)<br \/>\n(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/RSTP-Rights-of-PSRs-National-Updated-Feb-14-2018-1_Amharic_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amharic<\/a>)<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Mainly for refugees from Eritrea and Ethiopia<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/Final-Rights-of-PSRs-Feb-14-2018-Arabic-1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Arabic)<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/The-Rights-of-Privately-Sponsored-Refugees_Feb-14-2018-Armenian.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Armenian)<\/a><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Mainly for refugees from Armenia, Syria, Lebanon and Turkey<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/The-Rights-of-Privately-Sponsored-Refugees_Feb-14-2018-KurdishKurmanji.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Kurmanji<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/The-Rights-of-Privately-Sponsored-Refugees_Feb-14-2018-KurdishKurmanji.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">)<\/a><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Mainly for refugees from Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey<\/span><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/The-Rights-of-Privately-Sponsored-Refugees-Feb-14-2018-KurdishSorani.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">(Sorani)<\/a><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Rights-of-PSR-Oct.-2019-FINAL_FA.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Farsi<\/a>)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/Rights-of-PSR-Oct.-2019-FINAL_PS-1.pdf\">Pashto<\/a>)<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Mainly for refugees from Iran,\u00a0 Iraq and Afghanistan<\/span><br \/>\n(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/RSTP-Rights-of-PSRs-National-Updated-Feb-14-2018-_Tigrinya_final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tigrinya<\/a>)<br \/>\n<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;\">Mainly for refugees from Eritrea and Ethiopia<\/span><br \/><\/div><div class='clear_column'><\/div>\n<h3>What Should You Receive from your Sponsors?<\/h3>\n<div class='content-column one_half'><div style=\"padding-right:20px;\"><h3>1.
