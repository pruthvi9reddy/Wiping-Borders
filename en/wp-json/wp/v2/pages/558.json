In other sources this number increases up to 1,200,000 and sometimes even higher. It is difficult to provide an exact number of Iraqis who have to seek asylum on Syrian territory because of the urbanized nature of their settlement and the fact that not all Iraqi refugees register with the Syrian authorities or with UNHCR.<\/p>\n<p>In anticipation of a refugee influx due to the war in Iraq, Syria was the only country that implemented the Temporary Protection Regime (TP) that was meant to prevent deportation of Iraqis. Iraqis who crossed the border to Syria enjoyed unrestricted acceptance and full access to healthcare and education. As a result, a large number of Iraqis settled in Syria, making it difficult for this country to accommodate and support these refugees. Consequently, the TP regime was replaced by national immigration rules that were increasingly restrictive towards refugees that wanted to cross the Syrian border.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button style3\" href=\"#top\">Return to top<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><a name=\"5\"><\/a>Essential sources<\/h2>\n<p>UNHCR<em> Canada Resettlement Levels 2018 and Global Resettlement Needs<\/em>, available at <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.unhcr.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Canada-Refugee-Resettlement-numbers-2018-2020.6.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.unhcr.ca\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/11\/Canada-Refugee-Resettlement-numbers-2018-2020.6.pdf<\/a><\/strong> [accessed March 19, 2018].<\/p>\n<p>Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, <em>Iraq: Inter-sect marriage between Sunni and Shia Muslims, including prevalence; treatment of inter-sect spouses and their children by society and authorities, including in Baghdad; state protection available (2016-January 2018)<\/em>, 29 January 2018, IRQ106049.E, available at: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.refworld.org\/docid\/5aa916bb7.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">http:\/\/www.refworld.org\/docid\/5aa916bb7.html<\/a>.
