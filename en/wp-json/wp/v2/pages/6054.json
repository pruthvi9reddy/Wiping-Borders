If they sponsored you through an organization (for example, a Sponsorship Agreement Holder), share your concerns with the organization. If you are still not receiving support, or if you are afraid to approach your sponsors, you should <strong>contact <em>Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). <\/em><\/strong>There are no consequences to contacting IRCC, and your Permanent Resident status will not be impacted. IRCC will try to find a solution to the problem.<\/p>\n<p>You can contact IRCC by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>emailing\u00a0<a href=\"mailto:IRCC.INPSR-PPPRRI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca\">IRCC.INPSR-PPPRRI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca<\/a><b>\u00a0<\/b>to be connected to the appropriate Local IRCC office, or<\/li>\n<li>calling IRCC\u2019s general Call Centre at 1-888-242-2100.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Eventually, you will be connected with a Local IRCC office (which is often the IRCC office located in your area).<\/p>\n<p>The Local IRCC office will ask you questions about the situation, and may also speak to your sponsoring group. They will try to gather information, such as how much financial and settlement support you are being given, and reasons why you may not be receiving enough support. While they are doing this research, if the Local IRCC office finds that you require financial support urgently, it is possible that they may provide you with some emergency funds. The Local IRCC office will also make a final decision about who will provide you with financial and settlement support. If they find that it is true that you are not receiving enough support, and your sponsoring group is unable or unwilling to provide you with more support, they may declare a \u201csponsorship breakdown.\u201d This means that your sponsoring group would no longer be responsible for providing you with financial and settlement support for the rest of the sponsorship period. In this case, you may:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>be given another sponsoring group, or<\/li>\n<li>be given government funding, or<\/li>\n<li>be told that you can apply for provincial social assistance.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Depending on the circumstances of the case, there may be some consequences to the sponsoring group. For example, they may have to pay the government back for the government funding or provincial social assistance that you receive.<\/p>\n<p>It is important to remember that solutions and consequences are determined on a case by case basis by IRCC.<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"button style1\" style=\"margin-bottom: 25px;\" href=\"http:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/your-rights-as-a-privately-sponsored-refugee\/\">Back<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If you believe that your private sponsors are not providing you with the support that they are supposed to provide, talk to your sponsor about your concerns if you are [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":5,"featured_media":0,"parent":5940,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_relevanssi_hide_post":"","_relevanssi_hide_content":"","_relevanssi_pin_for_all":"","_relevanssi_pin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_unpin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_include_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_exclude_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_no_append":"","_relevanssi_related_not_related":"","_relevanssi_related_posts":"","_relevanssi_noindex_reason":"","passster_activate_protection":false,"passster_protect_child_pages":"","passster_protection_type":"password","passster_password":"","passster_activate_overwrite_defaults":"","passster_headline":"","passster_instruction":"","passster_placeholder":"","passster_button":"","passster_id":"","passster_activate_misc_settings":"","passster_redirect_url":"","passster_hide":"no","passster_area_shortcode":"","_price":"","_stock":"","_tribe_ticket_header":"","_tribe_default_ticket_provider":"","_tribe_ticket_capacity":"0","_ticket_start_date":"","_ticket_end_date":"","_tribe_ticket_show_description":"","_tribe_ticket_show_not_going":false,"_tribe_ticket_use_global_stock":"","_tribe_ticket_global_stock_level":"","_global_stock_mode":"","_global_stock_cap":"","_tribe_rsvp_for_event":"","_tribe_ticket_going_count":"","_tribe_ticket_not_going_count":"","_tribe_tickets_list":[],"_tribe_ticket_has_attendee_info_fields":false},"meta_box":{"front_blocks":[]},"ticketed":false,"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6054"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/5"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=6054"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6054\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7277,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/6054\/revisions\/7277"}],"up":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/5940"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=6054"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
