Some of the contributing factors relate to the over-emphasis on sexual conduct rather than orientation and\/or identity, criminalization, the role of social visibility in determining \u2018membership in a particular social group\u2019, and assessments of \u2018evidence\u2019 and credibility.<\/p>\n<p>Refugees fleeing persecution on the grounds of their sexual orientation and\/or gender identity and who meet the eligibility and admissibility requirements of the Canadian resettlement program can be resettled to Canada under the Private Refugee Sponsorship Program. It can be more difficult to identify LGBTI refugees for private sponsorship as it is often not safe for LGBTI asylum seekers to disclose their sexual orientation and\/or gender identity in the country of asylum. However, with the help of local NGOs and international humanitarian organizations, such as the UNHCR, a number of LGBTI refugee cases have been brought to the attention of private sponsoring groups in Canada and have already arrived or are in process of being sponsored to come to Canada. LGBTI refugee cases are identified for sponsorship and need sponsors under the Blended VOR Initiative.
