Failing to consider this criterion can lead to sponsored refugees approved by CIC not receiving the necessary exit permits from the Government of Turkey for resettlement to Canada.<\/p>\n<p>In order to increase the chances of being granted exit permission from Turkey, sponsored refugees should be registered with local Turkish authorities as demonstrated by having a valid one of the following documents:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Residence permit (Ikamet) in the form of an Ikamet Izni or Ikamet Tezkeresi;<\/li>\n<li>Temporary residence document such as visa or work permit (does not include\u00a0electronic visas);<\/li>\n<li>Yabanci Tanitma Belgesi (Foreigner ID Document) or Yabanci Tanitim Karti\u00a0(Foreigner ID Card);<\/li>\n<li>S\u0131\u011f\u0131nma ba\u015fvuru sahibi tan\u0131t\u0131m kart\u0131 (Foreigner Registration Card);<\/li>\n<li>Uluslararas\u0131 Koruma Ba\u015fvuru Sahibi Kimlik Belgesi (Identification Card for\u00a0International Protection Applicant);<\/li>\n<li>Uluslararas\u0131 Koruma Ba\u015fvuru Sahibi Kayit Belgesi (Registration Card for\u00a0International Protection Status Holder);<\/li>\n<li>Uluslararas\u0131 Koruma Stat\u00fcs\u00fc Sahibi Kimlik Belgesi (Identification Card for\u00a0International Protection Status Holder); or<\/li>\n<li>Gecici Koruma Kimlit Belgesi (Temporary Protection ID).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you have any questions about these guidelines, please <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/contact-us\/\">contact us<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>September 2015 &#8211; This guidance has been developed to assist private sponsors in identifying cases for resettlement from Turkey.
