A combination of one representative and one co-sponsor would satisfy this requirement as well. See the chart below for more details.\u00a0If a sponsor cannot meet the residency requirements when a sponsored family has moved, the case may lead to a no-fault or fault sponsorship breakdown. For more information on breakdowns and possible defaults, please see the following on <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/infosheet\/sponsorship-disputes-breakdowns\/?format=HTML\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sponsorship Disputes and Breakdowns<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>DEFINITIONS<\/h2>\n<p>A <strong>representative<\/strong> is a Canadian Citizen or Permanent Resident who is located within the refugee\u2019s community of settlement and is appointed to represent the sponsor in the community, in accordance with the scope and action of representation agreed upon between the representative and the sponsor. A representative is not a party to the sponsorship, and is not liable to fulfill the sponsorship obligations.<\/p>\n<p>A <strong>co-sponsor<\/strong> is a person or organization that partners with a SAH or CS to share responsibility for sponsorship support as per the Sponsorship Undertaking. They are jointly and severally liable to fulfill the sponsorship obligations.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Community of settlement<\/strong> is defined as the village, town or city and surrounding areas in which the refugee is expected to settle. The term community is used, as there may be situations in which the sponsor does not live directly in the same village, town or city but could be considered to reside in the same general community. In determining the community of settlement, the paramount consideration should be the sponsor\u2019s ability to provide adequate, in-person support to the refugee, taking into account the distance between the sponsor and the refugee.<\/p>\n<h2>APPOINTMENT OF REPRESENTATIVES<\/h2>\n<p>The appointment of representatives in no way removes the sponsorship group\u2019s legal obligations towards Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to fulfill all sponsorship responsibilities committed to via the Sponsorship Undertaking and outlined in the Settlement Plan; the signatories to the Sponsorship Undertaking remain jointly and severally responsible for the sponsorship. The sponsor and the representative(s) are responsible for agreeing upon the action and scope of representation and for establishing amongst themselves how the sponsorship support will be provided, but this agreement is outside the sponsor\u2019s contractual obligations with IRCC.<\/p>\n<p>The representatives cannot be legally bound to the sponsorship, unless they are formally added as co-sponsors through an updated Sponsorship Undertaking. It is therefore in the best interest of the sponsoring group to formally include the representatives as co-sponsors and therefore as parties to the Sponsorship Undertaking, as it would also bind them to the sponsorship obligations. However, in both scenarios, the sponsoring group who signed the Undertaking still bears ultimate responsibility to provide all sponsorship support should the assistance of the co-sponsor or representative(s) cease at any time during the sponsorship period.<\/p>\n<p>To appoint representatives, the sponsoring group must submit an <i>Appointment of Representatives in the Expected Community of Settlement<\/i> form (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.canada.ca\/content\/dam\/ircc\/migration\/ircc\/english\/pdf\/kits\/forms\/imm5956e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IMM 5956<\/a>). The IMM 5956 includes a Settlement Plan to explain how the sponsorship support will be provided in the new long distance arrangement. The Settlement Plan must explain the type of interaction that will be in place with the representatives and how the support will be provided via the representatives. For example, if winter clothing is required, the sponsoring group who signed the Sponsorship Undertaking would still be responsible to provide this financially by perhaps sending a money transfer to the representatives who will purchase and provide the clothing directly to the sponsored refugees.<\/p>\n<h2>OPTIONS FOR SATISFYING RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS<\/h2>\n<div class=\"table-wrap\">\n<table class=\"country-info\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><strong>SPONSORSHIP AGREEMENT HOLDER (SAH) RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT UNDER IRPR153(1)(a):<\/strong><br \/>\nEither the SAH, the CG, or a minimum of two co-sponsors or two appointed representatives or a combination of one representative and one co-sponsor must reside in the refugee\u2019s community of settlement.<\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>OPTIONS IF RESIDENCY REQUIREMENT NOT MET<\/strong><\/td>\n<td><strong>PROCEDURE<\/strong><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1.
