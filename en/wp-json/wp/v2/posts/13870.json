The IOM plays an essential role in helping Canada welcome refugees as the organization assists with pre-departure resettlement processing and\u00a0 provides direct assistance to refugees to travel to Canada, including securing exit permits, coordinating transportation to the airport, booking flights and providing assistance during transit.<\/p>\n<p>It is anticipated that the increase to the immigration loan cap will affect a limited number of refugees, as historically only 3% of loans for resettled refugees exceeded the former cap of $10,000. Resettled refugees facing hardships in repaying their loan can ask for a review to adjust their repayment arrangements. The loan is an agreement between IRCC and resettled refugees, and sponsoring groups are not responsible for covering the costs of the refugee\u2019s immigration loan.<\/p>\n<p>Should you need any further information, please do not hesitate to contact the IRCC PSR mailbox at <a href=\"mailto:IRCC.INRAPPAR-ILPPPI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">IRCC.INRAPPAR-ILPPPI.IRCC@cic.gc.ca<\/a>.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Please see the message below from IRCC on changes to the Immigration Loans Program that will come into effect as of September 1, 2021: The immigration loan cap per family [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":4,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_relevanssi_hide_post":"","_relevanssi_hide_content":"","_relevanssi_pin_for_all":"","_relevanssi_pin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_unpin_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_keywords":"","_relevanssi_related_include_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_exclude_ids":"","_relevanssi_related_no_append":"","_relevanssi_related_not_related":"","_relevanssi_related_posts":"","_relevanssi_noindex_reason":"","passster_activate_protection":false,"passster_protect_child_pages":"","passster_protection_type":"password","passster_password":"","passster_activate_overwrite_defaults":"","passster_headline":"","passster_instruction":"","passster_placeholder":"","passster_button":"","passster_id":"","passster_activate_misc_settings":"","passster_redirect_url":"","passster_hide":"no","passster_area_shortcode":"","_price":"","_stock":"","_tribe_ticket_header":"","_tribe_default_ticket_provider":"","_tribe_ticket_capacity":"0","_ticket_start_date":"","_ticket_end_date":"","_tribe_ticket_show_description":"","_tribe_ticket_show_not_going":false,"_tribe_ticket_use_global_stock":"","_tribe_ticket_global_stock_level":"","_global_stock_mode":"","_global_stock_cap":"","_tribe_rsvp_for_event":"","_tribe_ticket_going_count":"","_tribe_ticket_not_going_count":"","_tribe_tickets_list":[],"_tribe_ticket_has_attendee_info_fields":false},"categories":[7],"tags":[],"meta_box":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13870"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/4"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=13870"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13870\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":13876,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13870\/revisions\/13876"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=13870"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=13870"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/www.rstp.ca\/en\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=13870"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
